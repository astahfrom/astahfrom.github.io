      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a postdoc at DIKU starting August 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked for a year as a full-stack software developer at Dalux where I:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>refined the suite of concurrent, end-to-end Cypress tests,</li>
        <li>improved the handling and stamping of PDFs,</li>
        <li>wrote a Roslyn code analyser to detect would-be runtime errors at compile time,</li>
        <li>worked on integrating full Angular template type checking,</li>
        <li>and more...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was a PhD student at DTU Compute from February 2020 to February 2023 working on <em>Formally Correct
          Deduction
          Methods for Computational Logic</em>, especially using the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. My supervisor was
        Jørgen
        Villadsen and my co-supervisor was Nina Gierasimczuk.
        DTU granted me a Young Researcher Award for my PhD.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I was a MSc student on the Honours Programme in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU from 2018
        to
        2020 and a BSc student in software technology at DTU from 2014 to 2018.

                <p>I strengthen the foundations of epistemic logic by formalizing the family of normal modal logics in
                  the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. I define an abstract canonical model over any set of axioms and
                  formalize completeness-via-canonicity: when the canonical model for the chosen axioms belong to a
                  certain class of frames, strong completeness over that class follows immediately. I instantiate the
                  result with logics based on various epistemic principles to obtain completeness results for systems
                  from K to S5. I then move to a family of public announcement logics (PAL) and prove abstract results
                  for strong soundness and completeness. I lift the completeness results from epistemic logic to the
                  setting with public announcements in a modular way. This work formulates the
                  completeness-via-canonicity technique as a proper theorem and demonstrates its applicability.
                  Additionally, it succinctly formalizes the requirements for lifting completeness from bare epistemic
                  logic to the addition of public announcements.</p>

                <p>We describe the design, implementation and verification of an automated theorem prover for
                  first-order logic with functions. The proof search procedure is based on sequent calculus and we
                  formally verify its soundness and completeness in Isabelle&#x2F;HOL using an existing abstract
                  framework for coinductive proof trees. Our analytic completeness proof covers both open and closed
                  formulas. Since our deterministic prover considers only the subset of terms relevant to proving a
                  given sequent, we do so as well when building a countermodel from a failed proof. Finally, we formally
                  connect our prover with the proof system and semantics of the existing SeCaV system. In particular,
                  the prover can generate human-readable SeCaV proofs which are also machine-verifiable proof
                  certificates.</p>

                <p>The analytic technique for proving completeness gives a very operational perspective: build a
                  countermodel to the unproved formula from a failed proof attempt in your calculus. We have to be
                  careful, however, that the proof attempt did not fail because our strategy in finding it was flawed.
                  Overcoming this concern requires designing a prover. We design and formalize in Isabelle&#x2F;HOL a
                  sequent calculus prover for first-order logic with functions. We formalize soundness and completeness
                  theorems using an existing framework and extract executable code to Haskell. The crucial idea is to
                  move complexity from the prover itself to a stream of instructions that it follows. The result serves
                  as a minimal example of the analytic technique, a naive prover for first-order logic, and a case study
                  in formal verification.</p>

                <p>We formalize in Isabelle&#x2F;HOL soundness and completeness of a one-sided sequent calculus for
                  first-order logic. The completeness is shown via a translation from a semantic tableau calculus, whose
                  completeness proof we base on the theory entry ‘First-Order Logic According to Fitting’ by Berghofer
                  in the Archive of Formal Proofs. The calculi and proof techniques are taken from Ben-Ari’s textbook
                  Mathematical Logic for Computer Science (Springer, 2012). We thereby demonstrate that Berghofer’s
                  approach works not only for natural deduction but also constitutes a framework for mechanically
                  checked completeness proofs for a range of proof systems.</p>

The completeness is shown via a translation from a semantic tableau calculus, whose completeness proof we base on the theory entry ‘First-Order Logic According to Fitting’ by Berghofer in the Archive of Formal Proofs. The calculi and proof techniques are taken from Ben-Ari’s textbook Mathematical Logic for Computer Science (Springer, 2012). We thereby demonstrate that Berghofer’s approach works not only for natural deduction but also constitutes a framework for mechanically checked completeness proofs for a range of proof systems.},

                  classical propositional logic all with soundness and completeness theorems formalized in the proof
                  assistant Isabelle/HOL. We have previously only formalized systems based on either implication and
                  falsity or on disjunction and negation. We have now formalized 12 additional systems based on
                  implication and negation. Each of them has three or more axioms. We have also formalized single-axiom
                  systems, by Lukasiewicz and Tarski as well as by Meredith, and we describe the formalization of the
                  former in detail. A few systems with two axioms are described too.</p>

                <p>We present Aesop, a proof search tactic for the Lean 4 interactive theorem prover. Aesop performs a
                  tree-based search over a user-specified set of proof rules. It supports safe and unsafe rules and uses
                  a best-first search strategy with customisable prioritisation. Aesop also allows users to register
                  custom normalisation rules and integrates Lean's simplifier to support equational reasoning. Many
                  details of Aesop's search procedure are designed to make it a white-box proof automation tactic,
                  meaning that users should be able to easily predict how their rules will be applied, and thus how
                  powerful and fast their Aesop invocations will be. Since we use a best-first search strategy, it is
                  not obvious how to handle metavariables which appear in multiple goals. The most common strategy for
                  dealing with metavariables relies on backtracking and is therefore not suitable for best-first search.
                  We give an algorithm which addresses this issue. The algorithm works with any search strategy, is
                  independent of the underlying logic and makes few assumptions about how rules interact with
                  metavariables. We conjecture that with a fair search strategy, the algorithm is as complete as the
                  given set of rules allows.</p>

                <p>Automated reasoning is the study of computer programs that can build proofs of theorems in a logic.
                  Such programs can be either automatic theorem provers or interactive theorem provers. The latter are
                  also called proof assistants because the user constructs the proofs with the help of the system. We
                  focus on the Isabelle proof assistant. The system ensures that the proofs are correct, in contrast to
                  pen-and-paper proofs which must be checked manually. We present applications to logical systems and
                  models of information, in particular selected modal logics extending classical propositional logic.
                  Epistemic logic allows intelligent systems to reason about the knowledge of agents. Public
                  announcements can change the knowledge of the system and its agents. In order to account for this,
                  epistemic logic can be extended to public announcement logic. An axiomatic system consists of axioms
                  and rules of inference for deriving statements in a logic. Sound systems can only derive valid
                  statements and complete systems can derive all valid statements. We describe formalizations of sound

                <p>We strengthen the foundations of epistemic logic by formalizing the family of normal modal logics in
                  the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. We define an abstract canonical model and prove a truth lemma for

The formalization shows how to lift certain rule restrictions, thereby simplifying the original un-formalized proof. Moreover, the completeness proof we formalize is synthetic which suggests we can extend this work to prove a wider range of results about hybrid logic.},

                <p>Proof assistants are important tools for teaching logic. We support this claim by discussing three
                  formalizations in Isabelle/HOL used in a recent course on automated reasoning. The first is a
                  formalization of System W (a system of classical propositional logic with only two primitive symbols),
                  the second is the Natural Deduction Assistant (NaDeA), and the third is a one-sided sequent calculus
                  that uses our Sequent Calculus Verifier (SeCaV). We describe each formalization in turn, concentrating
                  on how we used them in our teaching, and commenting on features that are interesting or useful from a
                  logic education perspective. In the conclusion, we reflect on the lessons learned and where they might

                <p>Classical first-order logic is in many ways central to work in mathematics, linguistics, computer
                  science and artificial intelligence, so it is worthwhile to define it in full detail. We present
                  soundness and completeness proofs of a sequent calculus for first-order logic, formalized in the
                  interactive proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. Our formalization is based on work by Stefan Berghofer,
                  which we have since updated to use Isabelle's declarative proof style Isar (Archive of Formal Proofs,
                  Entry FOL-Fitting, August 2007 / July 2018). We represent variables with de Bruijn indices; this makes
                  substitution under quantifiers less intuitive for a human reader. However, the nature of natural
                  numbers yields an elegant solution when compared to implementations of substitution using variables
                  represented by strings. The sequent calculus considered has the special property of an always empty
                  antecedent and a list of formulas in the succedent. We obtain the proofs of soundness and completeness
                  for the sequent calculus as a derived result of the inverse duality of its tableau counterpart. We
                  strive to not only present the results of the proofs of soundness and completeness, but also to
                  provide a deep dive into a programming-like approach to the formalization of first-order logic syntax,
                  semantics and the sequent calculus. We use the formalization in a bachelor course on logic for

                <p>The Students' Proof Assistant (SPA) aims to both teach how to use a proof assistant like Isabelle and
                  also to teach how reliable proof assistants are built. Technically it is a miniature proof assistant
                  inside the Isabelle proof assistant. In addition we conjecture that a good way to teach structured
                  proving is with a concrete prover where the connection between semantics, proof system, and prover is
                  clear. The proofs in Lamport's TLAPS proof assistant have a very similar structure to those in the
                  declarative prover SPA. To illustrate this we compare a proof of Pelletier's problem 43 in TLAPS,
                  Isabelle/Isar and SPA. We also consider Pelletier's problem 34, also known as Andrews's Challenge,
                  where students are encouraged to develop their own justification function and thus obtain a lot of
                  insight into the proof assistant. Although SPA is fully functional we have so far only used it in a
                  few educational scenarios.</p>

                <p>We describe our Natural Deduction Assistant (NaDeA) and the interfaces between the Isabelle proof
                  assistant and NaDeA. In particular, we explain how NaDeA, using a generated prover that has been
                  verified in Isabelle, provides feedback to the student, and also how NaDeA, for each formula proved by
                  the student, provides a generated theorem that can be verified in Isabelle.</p>

                  in an automated reasoning course at DTU where they concretize discussions of soundness and

                  proof assistant. Proofs that have been informal in previous courses, for instance of termination, can
                  now be verified by the machine, and the provers provide practical examples. Similarly, the formal

                <p>In this work, I provide an abstract framework for proving the completeness of a logical calculus
                  using the synthetic method. The synthetic method is based on maximal consistent saturated sets (MCSs).
                  A set of formulas is consistent (with respect to the calculus) when we cannot derive a contradiction
                  from it. It is maximally consistent when it contains every formula that is consistent with it. For
                  logics where it is relevant, it is saturated when it contains a witness for every existential formula.
                  To prove completeness using these maximal consistent saturated sets, we prove a truth lemma: every
                  formula in an MCS has a satisfying model. Here, Hintikka sets provide a useful stepping stone. These
                  can be seen as characterizations of the MCSs based on simple subformula conditions rather than via the
                  calculus. We then prove that every Hintikka set gives rise to a satisfying model and that MCSs are
                  Hintikka sets. Now, assume a valid formula cannot be derived. Then its negation must be consistent and
                  therefore satisfiable. This contradicts validity and the original formula must be derivable. To start,
                  I build maximal consistent saturated sets for any logic that satisfies a small set of assumptions. I
                  do this using a transfinite version of Lindenbaum's lemma, which allows me to support languages of any
                  cardinality. I then prove useful abstract results about derivations and refutations as they relate to
                  MCSs. Finally, I show how Hintikka sets can be derived from the logic's semantics, outlining one way
                  to prove the required truth lemma. To demonstrate the versatility of the framework, I instantiate it
                  with five different examples. The formalization contains soundness and completeness results for: a
                  propositional tableau calculus, a propositional sequent calculus, an axiomatic system for modal logic,
                  a labelled natural deduction system for hybrid logic and a natural deduction system for first-order
                  logic. The tableau example uses custom Hintikka sets based on the calculus, but the other four
                  examples derive them from the semantics in the style of the framework. The hybrid and first-order
                  logic examples rely on saturated MCSs. This places requirements on the cardinalities of their
                  languages to ensure that there are enough witnesses available. In both cases, the type of witnesses
                  must be infinite and have cardinality at least that of the type of propositional/predicate symbols.

                <p> The AFP entry Abstract Completeness by Blanchette, Popescu and Traytel formalizes the core of
                  Beth/Hintikka-style completeness proofs for first-order logic and can be used to formalize executable
                  sequent calculus provers. In the Journal of Automated Reasoning, the authors instantiate the framework
                  with a sequent calculus for first-order logic and prove its completeness. Their use of an infinite set
                  of proof rules indexed by formulas yields very direct arguments. A fair stream of these rules controls
                  the prover, making its definition remarkably simple. The AFP entry, however, only contains a toy
                  example for propositional logic. The AFP entry A Sequent Calculus Prover for First-Order Logic with
                  Functions by From and Jacobsen also uses the framework, but uses a finite set of generic rules
                  resulting in a more sophisticated prover with more complicated proofs. This entry contains an
                  executable sequent calculus prover for first-order logic with functions in the style presented by
                  Blanchette et al. The prover can be exported to Haskell and this entry includes formalized proofs of
                  its soundness and completeness. The proofs are simpler than those for the prover by From and Jacobsen
                  but the performance of the prover is significantly worse. The included theory Fair-Stream first proves
                  that the sequence of natural numbers 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, etc. is fair. It then proves that mapping any
                  surjective function across the sequence preserves fairness. This method of obtaining a fair stream of
                  rules is similar to the one given by Blanchette et al. The concrete functions from natural numbers to
                  terms, formulas and rules are defined using the Nat-Bijection theory in the HOL-Library. </p>

                <p>This work is a formalization of soundness and completeness proofs for a Seligman-style tableau system
                  for hybrid logic. The completeness result is obtained via a synthetic approach using maximally
                  consistent sets of tableau blocks. The formalization differs from previous work in a few ways. First,
                  to avoid the need to backtrack in the construction of a tableau, the formalized system has no unnamed
                  initial segment, and therefore no Name rule. Second, I show that the full Bridge rule is admissible in
                  the system. Third, I start from rules restricted to only extend the branch with new formulas,
                  including only witnessing diamonds that are not already witnessed, and show that the unrestricted
                  rules are admissible. Similarly, I start from simpler versions of the @-rules and show that these are
                  sufficient. The GoTo rule is restricted using a notion of potential such that each application
                  consumes potential and potential is earned through applications of the remaining rules. I show that if
                  a branch can be closed then it can be closed starting from a single unit. Finally, Nom is restricted
                  by a fixed set of allowed nominals. The resulting system should be terminating. Paper:

                <p>This work formalizes soundness and completeness of a one-sided sequent calculus for first-order
                  logic. The completeness is shown via a translation from a complete semantic tableau calculus, the
                  proof of which is based on the First-Order Logic According to Fitting theory. The calculi and proof
                  techniques are taken from Ben-Ari's Mathematical Logic for Computer Science. Paper:
