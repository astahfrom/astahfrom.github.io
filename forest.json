Their use of an infinite set of proof rules indexed by formulas yields very direct arguments. A fair stream of these rules controls the prover, making its definition remarkably simple.

The completeness proof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a maximal consistent set using Lindenbaum's construction and Henkin witnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as well. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model existence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe.

Our formalization is based on work by Stefan Berghofer, which we have since updated to use Isabelle's declarative proof style Isar (Archive of Formal Proofs, Entry FOL-Fitting, August 2007 / July 2018). We represent variables with de Bruijn indices; this makes substitution under quantifiers less intuitive for a human reader. However, the nature of natural numbers yields an elegant solution when compared to implementations of substitution using variables represented by strings. The sequent calculus considered has the special property of an always empty antecedent and a list of formulas in the succedent. We obtain the proofs of soundness and completeness for the sequent calculus as a derived result of the inverse duality of its tableau counterpart. We strive to not only present the results of the proofs of soundness and completeness, but also to provide a deep dive into a programming-like approach to the formalization of first-order logic syntax, semantics and the sequent calculus.

We focus on the Isabelle proof assistant. The system ensures that the proofs are correct, in contrast to pen-and-paper proofs which must be checked manually. We present applications to logical systems and models of information, in particular selected modal logics extending classical propositional logic. Epistemic logic allows intelligent systems to reason about the knowledge of agents. Public announcements can change the knowledge of the system and its agents. In order to account for this, epistemic logic can be extended to public announcement logic. An axiomatic system consists of axioms and rules of inference for deriving statements in a logic. Sound systems can only derive valid statements and complete systems can derive all valid statements.

Many details of Aesop's search procedure are designed to make it a white-box proof automation tactic, meaning that users should be able to easily predict how their rules will be applied, and thus how powerful and fast their Aesop invocations will be. Since we use a best-first search strategy, it is not obvious how to handle metavariables which appear in multiple goals. The most common strategy for dealing with metavariables relies on backtracking and is therefore not suitable for best-first search. We give an algorithm which addresses this issue.

Second, I show that the full Bridge rule is admissible in the system. Third, I start from rules restricted to only extend the branch with new formulas, including only witnessing diamonds that are not already witnessed, and show that the unrestricted rules are admissible. Similarly, I start from simpler versions of the @-rules and show that these are sufficient. The GoTo rule is restricted using a notion of potential such that each application consumes potential and potential is earned through applications of the remaining rules. I show that if a branch can be closed then it can be closed starting from a single unit. Finally, Nom is restricted by a fixed set of allowed nominals. The resulting system should be terminating.

The synthetic method is based on maximal consistent saturated sets (MCSs). A set of formulas is consistent (with respect to the calculus) when we cannot derive a contradiction from it. It is maximally consistent when it contains every formula that is consistent with it. For logics where it is relevant, it is saturated when it contains a witness for every existential formula. To prove completeness using these maximal consistent saturated sets, we prove a truth lemma: every formula in an MCS has a satisfying model. Here, Hintikka sets provide a useful stepping stone. These can be seen as characterizations of the MCSs based on simple subformula conditions rather than via the calculus. We then prove that every Hintikka set gives rise to a satisfying model and that MCSs are Hintikka sets. Now, assume a valid formula cannot be derived. Then its negation must be consistent and therefore satisfiable. This contradicts validity and the original formula must be derivable. To start, I build maximal consistent saturated sets for any logic that satisfies a small set of assumptions. I do this using a transfinite version of Lindenbaum's lemma, which allows me to support languages of any cardinality. I then prove useful abstract results about derivations and refutations as they relate to MCSs. Finally, I show how Hintikka sets can be derived from the logic's semantics, outlining one way to prove the required truth lemma. To demonstrate the versatility of the framework, I instantiate it with five different examples. The formalization contains soundness and completeness results for: a propositional tableau calculus, a propositional sequent calculus, an axiomatic system for modal logic, a labelled natural deduction system for hybrid logic and a natural deduction system for first-order logic. The tableau example uses custom Hintikka sets based on the calculus, but the other four examples derive them from the semantics in the style of the framework. The hybrid and first-order logic examples rely on saturated MCSs. This places requirements on the cardinalities of their languages to ensure that there are enough witnesses available. In both cases, the type of witnesses must be infinite and have cardinality at least that of the type of propositional/predicate symbols.},\nauthor = {Asta Halkjær From},\nissn = {2150-914x},\njournal = {Archive of Formal Proofs},\nmonth = {January},\ntitle = {Synthetic Completeness},\nurl = {https://isa-afp.org/entries/Synthetic_Completeness.html},\nyear = {2023},\n}"}},"ahfrom-aschlichtkrull-jvilladsen-2021-cilc":{"title":"A Sequent Calculus for First-Order Logic Formalized in Isabelle/HOL","taxon":"Reference","tags":["proceedings"],"route":"/ahfrom-aschlichtkrull-jvilladsen-2021-cilc/","metas":{"external":"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3002/paper7.pdf","venue":"In S.
