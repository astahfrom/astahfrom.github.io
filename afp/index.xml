            <html:p>This work is a formalization of the soundness and completeness of an axiomatic system for first-order logic. The proof system is based on System Q1 by Smullyan and the completeness proof follows his textbook "First-Order Logic" (Springer-Verlag 1968). The completeness proof is in the Henkin style where a consistent set is extended to a maximal consistent set using Lindenbaum's construction and Henkin witnesses are added during the construction to ensure saturation as well. The resulting set is a Hintikka set which, by the model existence theorem, is satisfiable in the Herbrand universe. Paper: doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.TYPES.2021.8.</html:p>

abstract = {This work is a formalization of soundness and completeness proofs for a Seligman-style tableau system for hybrid logic. The completeness result is obtained via a synthetic approach using maximally consistent sets of tableau blocks. The formalization differs from previous work in a few ways. First, to avoid the need to backtrack in the construction of a tableau, the formalized system has no unnamed initial segment, and therefore no Name rule. Second, I show that the full Bridge rule is admissible in the system. Third, I start from rules restricted to only extend the branch with new formulas, including only witnessing diamonds that are not already witnessed, and show that the unrestricted rules are admissible. Similarly, I start from simpler versions of the @-rules and show that these are sufficient. The GoTo rule is restricted using a notion of potential such that each application consumes potential and potential is earned through applications of the remaining rules. I show that if a branch can be closed then it can be closed starting from a single unit. Finally, Nom is restricted by a fixed set of allowed nominals. The resulting system should be terminating.
